                and responsibilities when using our online workplace productivity tools and platform (the “Services”).
                Please read them carefully. If you are a Customer (defined below), these Customer Terms govern your access
                and use of our Services. If you are being invited to a team set up by a Customer, the User Terms of Service
                (the “User Terms” ) govern your access and use of the Services. We are grateful you’re here.</p>
              <h2 class="mt-5">First Things First</h2>
              <h3 class="mt-5">These “Customer Terms” Form a Part of a Binding “Contract”</h3>
              <p>These Customer Terms (or, if applicable, your written agreement with us) and any Order Form(s) (defined
                below) together form a binding “Contract” between Customer and us. If any terms in the Customer-Specific
                Supplement apply to Customer (e.g., if Customer is a U.S. government entity), those terms are also
                incorporated herein by reference and form part of the Contract. “We”, “Mongrov”, “mongrov.com”, “our” and
                “us” currently refer to Mongrov, Inc.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Your Agreement On Behalf of “Customer”</h3>
              <p>If you purchase subscription(s), create a team (i.e., a unique URL where a group of users may access the
                Services, as further described in our Help Center pages), invite users to that team, or use or allow use of
                that team after being notified of a change to these Customer Terms, you acknowledge your understanding of
                the then-current Contract and agree to the Contract on behalf of Customer. Please make sure you have the
                necessary authority to enter into the Contract on behalf of Customer before proceeding.</p>
              <h2 class="mt-5">Customer Choices and Instructions</h2>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Who is “Customer”? (Hint: There can be only one)</h3>
              <p><strong> “Customer”</strong> is the organization that you represent in agreeing to the Contract. If your
                team is being set up by someone who is not formally affiliated with an organization, Customer is the
                individual creating the team. For example, if you signed up using a personal email address and invited a
                couple of friends to work on a new startup idea but haven't formed a company yet, you are the Customer.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Signing Up Using a Corporate Email Domain</h3>
              <p>If you signed up for a plan using your corporate email domain, your organization is Customer, and Customer
                can modify and re-assign roles on your team (including your role) and otherwise exercise its rights under
                the Contract. If Customer elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the team,
                we will provide you with notice following such election and you agree to take any actions reasonably
                requested by us or Customer to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of Customer.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">What This Means for Customer—and for Us</h3>
              <p>Individuals authorized by Customer to access the Services (an <strong>“Authorized User”</strong>) may
                submit content or information to the Services, such as messages or files ( <strong>“Customer Data”</strong>
                ), and Customer may exclusively provide us with instructions on what to do with it. For example, Customer
                may provision or deprovision access to the Services, enable or disable third party integrations, manage
                permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign teams, share channels, or consolidate teams
                or channels with other teams or channels. Since these choices and instructions may result in the access,
                use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or all Customer Data, please review the Help Center
                pages for more information about these choices and instructions.</p>
              <p>Customer will (a) inform Authorized Users of all Customer policies and practices that are relevant to their
                use of the Services and of any settings that may impact the processing of Customer Data; and (b) obtain all
                rights, permissions or consents from Authorized Users and other Customer personnel that are necessary to
                grant the rights and licenses in the Contract and for the lawful use and transmission of Customer Data and
                the operation of the Services.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Ordering Subscriptions</h3>
              <p>A subscription allows an Authorized User to access the Services. No matter the role, a subscription is
                required for each Authorized User. A subscription may be procured through the Services interface, or in some
                cases, via an order form entered into between Customer and us (each, an
                <strong>“Order Form”</strong>). Please see the Help Center for more information on procuring subscriptions
                and inviting new Authorized Users. Each Authorized User must agree to the
                <a href="user-terms.html">User Terms</a> to activate their subscription. Subscriptions
                commence when we make them available to Customer and continue for the term specified in the Services
                “check-out” interface or in the Order Form, as applicable. Each subscription is for a single Authorized User
                for a specified term and is personal to that Authorized User. We sometimes enter into other kinds of
                ordering arrangements, but that would need to be spelled out and agreed to in an Order Form. During an
                active subscription term, adding more subscriptions is fairly easy. Unless the Order Form says otherwise,
                Customer may purchase more subscriptions at the same price stated in the Order Form and all will terminate
                on the same date. Check out our Help Center pages for additional information on setting up a team and
                assigning roles.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Purchasing Decisions</h3>
              <p>We may share information about our future product plans because we like transparency. Our public statements
                about those product plans are an expression of intent but do not rely on them when making a purchase. If
                Customer decides to buy our Services, that decision should be based on the functionality or features we have
                made available today and not on the delivery of any future functionality or features.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Choosing to be a Beta Tester</h3>
              <p>Occasionally, we look for beta testers to help us test our new features. These features will be identified
                as “beta” or “pre-release,” or words or phrases with similar meanings (each, a “Beta Product”). Beta
                Products may not be ready for prime time so they are made available “as is,” and any warranties or
                contractual commitments we make for other Services do not apply. Should Customer encounter any faults with
                our Beta Products, we would love to hear about them; our primary reason for running any beta programs is to
                iron out issues before making a new feature widely available.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Feedback is Welcome</h3>
              <p>The more suggestions our customers make, the better the Services become. If Customer sends us any feedback
                or suggestions regarding the Services, there is a chance we will use it, so Customer grants us (for itself
                and all of its Authorized Users and other Customer personnel) an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual,
                sub-licensable, transferable, royalty-free license to use any such feedback or suggestions for any purpose
                without any obligation or compensation to Customer, any Authorized User or other Customer personnel. If we
                choose not to implement the suggestion, please don’t take it personally. We appreciate it nonetheless.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Non-Mongrov Products</h3>
              <p>Our Services include a platform that third parties may use to develop applications and software that
                complement Customer’s use of the Services (each, a “Non-Mongrov Product”). We also maintain a directory
                called the Mongrov App Directory where some Non-Mongrov Products are available for installation. THESE ARE
                NOT OUR SERVICES, SO WE DO NOT WARRANT OR SUPPORT NON-Mongrov PRODUCTS, AND, ULTIMATELY, CUSTOMER (AND NOT
                US) WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ENABLE THEM. ANY USE OF A NON-Mongrov PRODUCT IS SOLELY BETWEEN CUSTOMER
                AND THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY PROVIDER.</p>
              <p>If a Non-Mongrov Product is enabled for Customer’s team, please be mindful of any Customer Data that will
                be shared with the third party provider and the purposes for which the provider requires access. We will not
                be responsible for any use, disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data that is transmitted to, or
                accessed by, a Non-Mongrov Product. Check out our Help Center pages for more information.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Privacy Policy</h3>
              <p>Please review our
                <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more information on how we collect and use
                data relating to the use and performance of our websites and products.</p>
              <h2 class="mt-5">Customer and Authorized Users</h2>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Use of the Services</h3>
              <p>Customer must comply with the Contract and ensure that its Authorized Users comply with the Contract and
                the User Terms. We may review conduct for compliance purposes, but we have no obligation to do so. We aren't
                responsible for the content of any Customer Data or the way Customer or its Authorized Users choose to use
                the Services to store or process any Customer Data. The Services are not intended for and should not be used
                by anyone under the age of 13. Customer must ensure that all Authorized Users are over 13 years old.
                Customer is solely responsible for providing high speed internet service for itself and its Authorized Users
                to access and use the Services.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Our Removal Rights</h3>
              <p>If we believe that there is a violation of the Contract that can simply be remedied by Customer’s removal
                of certain Customer Data or Customer’s disabling of a Non-Mongrov Product, we will, in most cases, ask
                Customer to take direct action rather than intervene. However, we may directly step in and take what we
                determine to be appropriate action, if Customer does not take appropriate action, or if we believe there is
                a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Authorized Users, or any third parties.</p>
              <h2 class="mt-5">Payment Obligations</h2>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Payment Terms</h3>
              <p>For Customers that purchase our Services, fees are specified at the Services interface “check-out” and in
                the Order Form(s) — and must be paid in advance. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as
                expressly stated in the Contract, fees paid are non-refundable. For clarity, in the event Customer
                downgrades any subscriptions from a paid plan to a free plan, Customer will remain responsible for any
                unpaid fees under the paid plan, and Services under the paid plan will be deemed fully performed and
                delivered upon expiration of the initial paid plan subscription term. Check out our Help Center pages for
                more information about payment options. If we agree to invoice Customer by email, full payment must be
                received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies,
                duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use
                or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer will be responsible
                for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases, except for those taxes based on our net income.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Fair Billing Policy</h3>
              <p>We believe customers should only pay for subscriptions that are actually used, so we offer a Fair Billing
                Policy. Certain exceptions and conditions may apply, as noted in the Services interface “check-out” or in an
                Order Form.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Credits</h3>
              <p>Any credits that may accrue to Customer’s account, will expire following expiration or termination of the
                applicable Contract, will have no currency or exchange value, and will not be transferable or refundable.
                Credits accrued to a team on a free subscription plan will expire if the team’s plan is not upgraded to a
                paid plan within one-hundred and eighty (180) days of accrual. For more information on credits, please see
                the Help Center.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Downgrade for Non-Payment</h3>
              <p>If any fees owed to us by Customer (excluding amounts disputed reasonably and in good faith) are thirty
                (30) days or more overdue, we may, without limiting our other rights and remedies, downgrade any fee-based
                Services to free plans until those amounts are paid in full, so long as we have given Customer ten (10) or
                more days’ prior notice that its account is overdue. Notwithstanding the second paragraph of the “Providing
                the Services” section below, Customer acknowledges and agrees that a downgrade will result in a decrease in
                certain features and functionality and potential loss of access to Customer Data, as illustrated by
                comparing the plans in the
                <a href="pricing.html">Pricing section</a>.</p>
              <h2 class="mt-5">Our Responsibilities</h2>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Providing the Services</h3>
              <p>Customer isn’t the only one with responsibilities; we have some, too. We will (a) make the Services
                available to Customer and its Authorized Users as described in the Contract; and (b) not use or process
                Customer Data for any purpose without Customer’s prior written instructions; provided, however, that “prior
                written instructions” will be deemed to include use of the Services by Authorized Users and any processing
                related to such use or otherwise necessary for the performance of the Contract.</p>
              <p>Be assured that (a) the Services will perform materially in accordance with our then-current Help Center
                pages; and (b) subject to the “ Non-Mongrov Products” and “Downgrade for Non-Payment” sections, we will not
                materially decrease the functionality of a Service during a subscription term. For any breach of a warranty
                in this section, Customer’s exclusive remedies are those described in the sections titled “Termination for
                Cause” and “Effect of Termination”.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Keeping the Services Available</h3>
              <p>As further described in our Help Center pages, for some of our Services, we also offer specific uptime
                commitments paired with credits, if we fall short. In those cases, the credits will serve as what the
                lawyers call liquidated damages and will be Customer’s sole remedy for the downtime and related
                inconvenience. For all Service plans, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services
                available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned downtime to be
                infrequent but will endeavor to provide Customer with advance notice (e.g., through the Services), if we
                think it may exceed five (5) continuous minutes.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Protecting Customer Data</h3>
              <p>The protection of Customer Data is a top priority for us so we will maintain administrative, physical, and
                technical safeguards at a level not materially less protective than as described in our Security Practices
                page. Those safeguards will include measures for preventing unauthorized access, use, modification, deletion
                and disclosure of Customer Data by our personnel. Before sharing Customer Data with any of our third party
                service providers, we will ensure that the third party maintains, at a minimum, reasonable data practices
                for maintaining the confidentiality and security of Customer Data and preventing unauthorized access.
                Customer (not us) bears sole responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup of Customer Data
                when in Customer’s or its representatives’ or agents’ possession or control or when Customer chooses to use
                unencrypted gateways (e.g., IRC/XMPP clients) to connect to the Services. We are not responsible for what
                Customer’s Authorized Users or Non-Mongrov Products do with Customer Data. That is Customer’s
                responsibility.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">The Mongrov Extended Family</h3>
              <p>We may leverage our employees, those of our corporate affiliates and third party contractors (the “Mongrov
                Extended Family”) in exercising our rights and performing our obligations under the Contract. We will be
                responsible for the Mongrov Extended Family’s compliance with our obligations under the Contract.</p>
              <h2 class="mt-5">Ownership and Proprietary Rights</h2>
              <h3 class="mt-5">What’s Yours is Yours...</h3>
              <p>As between us on the one hand, and Customer and any Authorized Users on the other, Customer will own all
                Customer Data. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Contract, Customer (for itself and all of its
                Authorized Users) grants us and the Mongrov Extended Family a worldwide, non-exclusive, limited term license
                to access, use, process, copy, distribute, perform, export and display Customer Data, and any Non-Mongrov
                Products created by or for Customer, only as reasonably necessary (a) to provide, maintain and improve the
                Services; (b) to prevent or address service, security, support or technical issues; (c) as required by law
                or as permitted by the Data Request Policy; and (d) as expressly permitted in writing by Customer. Customer
                represents and warrants that it has secured all rights in and to Customer Data from its Authorized Users as
                may be necessary to grant this license.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">And What’s Ours is Ours</h3>
              <p>We own and will continue to own our Services, including all related intellectual property rights. We may
                make software components available, via app stores or other channels, as part of the Services. We grant to
                Customer a non-sub licensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, limited license for Customer and its
                Authorized Users to use the object code version of these components, but solely as necessary to use the
                Services and in accordance with the Contract and the User Terms. All of our rights not expressly granted by
                this license are hereby retained.
              </p>
              <h2 class="mt-5">Term and Termination</h2>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Contract Term</h3>
              <p>As further described below, a free subscription continues until terminated, while a paid subscription has a
                term that may expire or be terminated. The Contract remains effective until all subscriptions ordered under
                the Contract have expired or been terminated or the Contract itself terminates. Termination of the Contract
                will terminate all subscriptions and all Order Forms.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Auto-Renewal</h3>
              <p>Unless an Order Form says something different, (a) all subscriptions automatically renew (without the need
                to go through the Services-interface “check-out” or execute a renewal Order Form) for additional periods
                equal to one (1) year or the preceding term, whichever is shorter; and (b) the per-unit pricing during any
                automatic renewal term will remain the same as it was during the immediately prior term. Either party can
                give the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of a subscription term to stop
                the subscriptions from automatically renewing.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Termination for Cause</h3>
              <p>We or Customer may terminate the Contract on notice to the other party if the other party materially
                breaches the Contract and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after the non-breaching party
                provides notice of the breach. Customer is responsible for its Authorized Users, including for any breaches
                of this Contract caused by its Authorized Users. We may terminate the Contract immediately on notice to
                Customer if we reasonably believe that the Services are being used by Customer or its Authorized Users in
                violation of applicable law.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Termination Without Cause</h3>
              <p>Customer may terminate its free subscriptions immediately without cause. We may also terminate Customer’s
                free subscriptions without cause, but we will provide Customer with thirty (30) days prior written notice.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Effect of Termination</h3>
              <p>Upon any termination for cause by Customer, we will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder
                of the term of all subscriptions after the effective date of termination. Upon any termination for cause by
                us, Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of those subscriptions after the
                effective date of termination. In no event will any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay
                any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Data Portability and Deletion</h3>
              <p>We are custodians of Customer Data. During the term of a team’s subscriptions, Customer will be permitted
                to export or share certain Customer Data from the Services; provided, however, that because we have
                different products with varying features and Customer has different retention options, Customer acknowledges
                and agrees that the ability to export or share Customer Data may be limited or unavailable depending on the
                type of Services plan in effect and the data retention, sharing or invite settings enabled. Following
                termination or expiration of a team’s subscriptions, we will have no obligation to maintain or provide any
                Customer Data and may thereafter, unless legally prohibited, delete all Customer Data in our systems or
                otherwise in our possession or under our control. Please review our Security Practices page for more
                information on how Customer itself can initiate deletion.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Representations; Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
              <p>Customer represents and warrants that it has validly entered into the Contract and has the legal power to
                do so. Customer further represents and warrants that it is responsible for the conduct of its Authorized
                Users and their compliance with the terms of this Contract and the User Terms. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED
                FOR HEREIN, THE SERVICES AND ALL RELATED COMPONENTS AND INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS
                AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES,
                WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A
                PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES
                WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Limitation of Liability</h3>
              <p>OTHER THAN IN CONNECTION WITH A PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER
                CUSTOMER’S OR THE Mongrov EXTENDED FAMILY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE CONTRACT OR
                THE USER TERMS (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY) EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT
                PAID BY CUSTOMER HEREUNDER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE LAST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. THE
                FOREGOING WILL NOT LIMIT CUSTOMER’S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE “PAYMENT TERMS” SECTION ABOVE.</p>
              <p>IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER CUSTOMER OR ANY MEMBER OF THE Mongrov EXTENDED FAMILY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE
                OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
                CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY
                OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE
                FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
              <p>The Services support optional logins using two-factor authentication (“2FA”), which is known to reduce the
                risk of unauthorized use of or access to the Services. We therefore will not be responsible for any damages,
                losses or liability to Customer, Authorized Users, or anyone else if any event leading to such damages,
                losses or liability would have been prevented by the use of 2FA. Additionally, Customer is responsible for
                all login credentials, including usernames and passwords, for administrator accounts as well the accounts of
                your Authorized Users. We will not be responsible for any damages, losses or liability to Customer,
                Authorized Users, or anyone else, if such information is not kept confidential by Customer or its Authorized
                Users, or if such information is correctly provided by an unauthorized third party logging into and
                accessing the Services.</p>
              <p>The limitations under this “Limitation of Liability” section apply with respect to all legal theories,
                whether in contract, tort or otherwise, and to the extent permitted by law. The provisions of this
                “Limitation of Liability” section allocate the risks under this Contract between the parties, and the
                parties have relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter into this Contract and the pricing
                for the Services.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Our Indemnification of Customer</h3>
              <p>We will defend Customer from and against any and all third party claims, actions, suits, proceedings, and
                demands alleging that the use of the Services as permitted under the Contract infringes or misappropriates a
                third party’s intellectual property rights (a “Claim Against Customer”), and will indemnify Customer for all
                reasonable attorney’s fees incurred and damages and other costs finally awarded against Customer in
                connection with or as a result of, and for amounts paid by Customer under a settlement we approve of in
                connection with, a Claim Against Customer; provided, however, that we will have no liability if a Claim
                Against Customer arises from (a) Customer Data or Non-Mongrov Products; and (b) any modification,
                combination or development of the Services that is not performed by us, including in the use of any
                application programming interface (API). Customer must provide us with prompt written notice of any Claim
                Against Customer and allow us the right to assume the exclusive defense and control, and cooperate with any
                reasonable requests assisting our defense and settlement of such matter. This section states our sole
                liability with respect to, and Customer’s exclusive remedy against us and the Mongrov Extended Family for,
                any Claim Against Customer.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Customer’s Indemnification of Us</h3>
              <p>Customer will defend Mongrov and the members of the Mongrov Extended Family (collectively, the “Mongrov
                Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all third party claims, actions, suits, proceedings, and
                demands arising from or related to Customer’s or any of its Authorized Users’ violation of the Contract or
                the User Terms (a “Claim Against Us”), and will indemnify the Mongrov Indemnified Parties for all reasonable
                attorney’s fees incurred and damages and other costs finally awarded against a Mongrov Indemnified Party in
                connection with or as a result of, and for amounts paid by a Mongrov Indemnified Party under a settlement
                Customer approves of in connection with, a Claim Against Us. We must provide Customer with prompt written
                notice of any Claim Against Us and allow Customer the right to assume the exclusive defense and control, and
                cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Customer’s defense and settlement of such matter. This
                section states your sole liability with respect to, and the Mongrov Indemnified Parties’ exclusive remedy
                against Customer for, any Claim Against Us.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Limitations On Indemnifications</h3>
              <p>Notwithstanding anything contained in the two preceding sections, (a) an indemnified party will always be
                free to choose its own counsel if it pays for the cost of such counsel; and (b) no settlement may be entered
                into by an indemnifying party, without the express written consent of the indemnified parties (such consent
                not to be unreasonably withheld), if (i) the third party asserting the claim is a government agency, (ii)
                the settlement arguably involves the making of admissions by the indemnified parties, (iii) the settlement
                does not include a full release of liability for the indemnified parties, or (iv) the settlement includes
                terms other than a full release of liability for the indemnified parties and the payment of money.</p>
              <h2 class="mt-5">Confidentiality</h2>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Confidential Information</h3>
              <p>Each party (“Disclosing Party”) may disclose “Confidential Information” to the other party (“Receiving
                Party”) in connection with the Contract, which is anything that reasonably should be understood to be
                confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure including all Order
                Forms, as well as non-public business, product, technology and marketing information. Confidential
                Information of Customer includes Customer Data. If something is labeled “Confidential,” that’s a clear
                indicator to the Receiving Party that the material is confidential. Notwithstanding the above, Confidential
                Information does not include information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without
                breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its
                disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (c) is
                received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (d) was
                independently developed by the Receiving Party.
              </p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Protection and Use of Confidential Information</h3>
              <p>The Receiving Party will (a) take at least reasonable measures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or
                use of Confidential Information, and limit access to those employees, affiliates and contractors who need to
                know such information in connection with the Contract , and ; (b) not use or disclose any Confidential
                Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Contract. Nothing above will
                prevent either party from sharing Confidential Information with financial and legal advisors; provided,
                however, that the advisors are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in the
                Contract.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Compelled Access or Disclosure</h3>
              <p>The Receiving Party may access or disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is
                required by law; provided, however, that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the
                compelled access or disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the
                Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the access or disclosure. Without
                limiting the foregoing, please review the Data Request Policy for details on how requests may be made for
                the disclosure of Customer Data and how we will handle those requests. If the Receiving Party is compelled
                by law to access or disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party will
                reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing access to such Confidential
                Information as well as the reasonable cost for any support provided in connection with the Disclosing Party
                seeking a protective order or confidential treatment for the Confidential Information to be produced.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Survival</h3>
              <p>The sections titled “Feedback is Welcome,” “Non-Mongrov Products,” “Our Removal Rights,” “Payment Terms,”

                heading “General Provisions,” will survive any termination or expiration of the Contract.</p>
              <h2 class="mt-5">General Provisions</h2>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Publicity</h4>
              <p>Customer grants us the right to use Customer’s company name and logo as a reference for marketing or
                promotional purposes on our website and in other public or private communications with our existing or
                potential customers, subject to Customer’s standard trademark usage guidelines as provided to us from
                time-to-time. We don’t want to list customers who don’t want to be listed, so Customer may send us an email
                to
                <a href="mailto:feedback@mongrov.com">feedback@mongrov.com</a> that it does not wish to be used as a
                reference.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Force Majeure</h3>
              <p>Neither us nor Customer will be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its
                obligations on account of events beyond the reasonable control of a party, which may include
                denial-of-service attacks, a failure by a third party hosting provider or utility provider, strikes,
                shortages, riots, fires, acts of God, war, terrorism, and governmental action.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Relationship of the Parties; No Third Party Beneficiaries</h3>
              <p>The parties are independent contractors. The Contract does not create a partnership, franchise, joint
                venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties. There are no third party
                beneficiaries to the Contract.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Email and Mongrov Messages</h3>
              <p>Except as otherwise set forth herein, all notices under the Contract will be by email, although we may
                instead choose to provide notice to Customer through the Services (e.g., a Mongrov bot notification).
                Notices to Mongrov will be sent to
                <a href="mailto:feedback@mongrov.com">feedback@mongrov.com</a>, except for legal notices, such as notices of
                termination or an indemnifiable claim, which must be sent to
                <a href="mailto:legal@mongrov.com">legal@mongrov.com</a>. Notices will be deemed to have been duly given (a)
                the day after it is sent, in the case of notices through email; and (b) the same day, in the case of notices
                through the Services.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Modifications</h4>
              <p>As our business evolves, we may change these Customer Terms and the other components of the Contract
                (except any Order Forms). If we make a material change to the Contract, we will provide Customer with
                reasonable notice prior to the change taking effect, either by emailing the email address associated with
                Customer’s account or by messaging Customer through the Services. Customer can review the most current
                version of the Customer Terms at any time by visiting this page and by visiting the most current versions of
                the other pages that are referenced in the Contract. The materially revised Contract will become effective
                on the date set forth in our notice, and all other changes will become effective upon posting of the change.
                If Customer (or any Authorized User) accesses or uses the Services after the effective date, that use will
                constitute Customer’s acceptance of any revised terms and conditions. Waiver</p>
              <p>No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under the Contract will constitute a waiver of
                that right. No waiver under the Contract will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an
                authorized representative of the party being deemed to have granted the waiver.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Severability</h3>
              <p>The Contract will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. If any provision of the
                Contract is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be modified
                by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the
                fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of the Contract will remain in effect.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Assignment</h3>
              <p>Except with respect to the Mongrov Extended Family, neither party may assign or delegate any of its rights
                or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the
                other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign the
                Contract in its entirety (including all Order Forms), without consent of the other party, to a corporate
                affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or
                substantially all of its v2/assets. Customer will keep its billing and contact information current at all
                times by notifying Mongrov of any changes. Any purported assignment in violation of this section is void. A
                party’s sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in breach of this section will be, at
                the non-assigning party’s election, termination of the Contract upon written notice to the assigning party.
                In the event of such a termination by Customer, we will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the
                remainder of the term of all subscriptions after the effective date of termination. Subject to the
                foregoing, the Contract will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and
                permitted assigns.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Governing Law</h3>
              <p>The Contract, and any disputes arising out of or related hereto, will be governed exclusively by the
                internal laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules or the United
                Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Fees</h3>
              <p>The state and federal courts located in Alameda County, California will have exclusive jurisdiction to
                adjudicate any dispute arising out of or relating to the Contract or its formation, interpretation or
                enforcement. Each party hereby consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Each party
                also hereby waives any right to jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising
                out of or related to the Contract. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Contract, the
                prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney’s fees.</p>
              <h3 class="mt-5">Entire Agreement</h3>
              <p>The Contract, including these Customer Terms and all referenced pages and Order Forms, if applicable,
                constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
                agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. Without limiting
                the foregoing, the Contract supersedes the terms of any online agreement electronically accepted by Customer
                or any Authorized Users. However, to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in
                these Customer Terms and any other documents or pages referenced in these Customer Terms, the following
                order of precedence will apply: (1) the terms of any Order Form (if any), (2) the portions of the
                Customer-Specific Supplement that apply to Customer (if any), (3) the Customer Terms and (4) finally any
                other documents or pages referenced in the Terms. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, no
                terms or conditions stated in a Customer purchase order, vendor onboarding process or web portal, or any
                other Customer order documentation (excluding Order Forms) will be incorporated into or form any part of the
                Contract, and all such terms or conditions will be null and void.</p>
